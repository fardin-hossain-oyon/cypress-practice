look at the following code:

cy.get('[id^=saw_]')
        .filter('.VSelDropDown')
        .each($el => {
            cy.wrap($el).select('Table'); // Apply select to each element
          });

Now, every VSelDropDown is in a <tr>. I want to go to the previous <tr> element, that exists in one step above the <tr> element containing the VSelDropDown. For example, if the structure is like this:

<tr> ..... <tr> ... <select class="VSelDropDown" ... > ... </tr> ... </tr>

I want to go to the first <tr>

Then I want to check if this <tr> contains any ViewContainer element with an attribute named viewType having value 'pivotTableView'.
As long as there is no such element, the program should wait.

How can I do this?
