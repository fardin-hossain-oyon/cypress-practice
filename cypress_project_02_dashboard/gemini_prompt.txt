look at the following code:

cy.get('[id^=saw_]')
        .filter('.VSelDropDown')
        .each($el => {
            cy.wrap($el).select('Table'); // Apply select to each element
          });

Now, every VSelDropDown is in a <tr>. I want to go to the previous <tr> element, that exists in one step above the <tr> element containing the VSelDropDown. For example, if the structure is like this:

<tr> ..... <tr> ... <select class="VSelDropDown" ... > ... </tr> ... </tr>

I want to go to the first <tr>

Then I want to check if this <tr> contains any ViewContainer element with an attribute named viewType having value 'pivotTableView'.
As long as there is no such element, the program should wait.

How can I do this?

          });

Now, after selecting 'Table', I want my program to wait as long as there is no element of 'ViewContainer' class having an attribute 'viewType' that holds a value 'pivotTableView' in the first parent <table class="CVTable"> element. What I mean is, after selecting the 'Table' view, the program will find the first parent <table class="CVTable"> element, then check if any <div class="ViewContainer" ... viewType="pivotTableView"> element exists in any of the descendants, if not found, then the program will wait.

Look at the following code:

cy.get('body', {timeout : 30000}).should(($body) => {
            expect($body.attr('style')).to.include('cursor: wait;', {timeout:30000});
          }, {timeout:30000});


I gave timeout 30000 in multiple places but it is not working, the code checks for default timeout of 4000 milliseconds. How do I fix this?
